## Welcome To Echo!
Echo is my first attempt at a full-stack project drawing inspiration from platforms such as Twitter and Reddit

## About The Project
As a self-learning web developer, I was often caught up in tutorial hell. Following the principle of "learn-from-building", this projects serves as a tool to expose myself to frameworks, libraries, and tools that are commonly used in front-end development.
Echo is not so much a show case of my critical thinking and creativity but rather a log of my progression as I familiarize myself with industry tools. The project is still very much in-progress as I continue to learn.
The tools I used for this project include:

- React
- Express
- MySQL
- Node.js
