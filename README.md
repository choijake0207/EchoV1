## Welcome To Echo!
Echo is my first attempt at a full-stack project drawing inspiration from platforms such as Twitter and Reddit

## About The Project
As a self-learning web developer, I was often caught up in tutorial hell. Following the principle of "learn-from-building", this projects serves as a tool to expose myself to frameworks, libraries, and tools that are commonly used in front-end development.
Echo is not so much a show case of my profiency and skill but rather a log of my progression and thought-processes as I familiarize myself with industry tools. The project is still very much in-progress as I continue to learn.
The tools I used for this project include:

- React
- Express
- MySQL
- Node.js

## Personal Comments and Notes
One of the major objectives for this project was to gain experience building something other than static sites. By committing to a full-stack project, I am attempting to familiarize myself with the following concepts:

- Building REST APIs
- Utilizng ORMs (sequelize)
- Managing Global States (authentication)
- Crafting DB associations
- Building DB models

Please expect a lot of commits as I continue to learn and refactor my code!
